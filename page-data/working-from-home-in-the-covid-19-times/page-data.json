While this is sad, and it has changed the way we interact and live; this blog post is to help software professionals who have the luxury of working from home during these times.</p>\n<p>I have put together these tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get a proper workspace, this could be a standing desk or traditional desk. Assuming you already have a laptop and mouse, it might be a good time to invest in a monitor and head phones. This will definetly help in the long run.</li>\n<li>Try to keep up with the usual work routine. Get up early like you would on a normal working day and do the regular activities whatever that might be say exercising, bathing, preparing food, dress properly etc...</li>\n<li>Make sure you have a water bottle with water to get you through the day.</li>\n<li>Swap your ride to work time with learning a new skill or technology that you had always wanted to learn. There are heaps of websites which have made their learning materials free now. Make the best use of it. </li>\n<li>There is a common tendency to work more while working from home so don't forget to take  proper lunch break and finish the day like you would normally. A simple alarm in the phone/clock will do the trick.</li>\n<li>This is a good time to bond with friends and family and this could be just replacing the usual interaction with voice and video calls. You can never do too much of this.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As they say, change is the only constant thing and this too shall pass! Stay home and stay safe!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"10th April, 2020","title":"Working from home in the COVID-19 times","tags":["rants","working from home","covid","covid-19","productivity tips"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/f6227/work-from-home.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/6b948/work-from-home.jpg 480w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/d1e22/work-from-home.jpg 960w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/f6227/work-from-home.jpg 1920w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/d8061/work-from-home.jpg 2700w","srcWebp":"/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/dc7e7/work-from-home.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/83f4f/work-from-home.webp 480w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/ce114/work-from-home.webp 960w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/dc7e7/work-from-home.webp 1920w,\n/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/b8e76/work-from-home.webp 2700w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/ac91ab74d04b13407824b86abfcd2902/a6c62/work-from-home.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/working-from-home-in-the-covid-19-times","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/hello-world","title":"Hello, World!","tags":["news"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/object-assign-gotchas","title":"Object.assign() gotchas","tags":["javascript","lodash","gotchas"]}}}}}
